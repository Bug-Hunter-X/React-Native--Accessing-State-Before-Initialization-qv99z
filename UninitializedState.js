This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is common when using functional components with useState hook. The problem is that useState is asynchronous and might not have assigned the value to your state variable right away. This can cause unexpected behaviour, like trying to render the component with an undefined or null value for your state variable.
